# Wordle data: Web scraping, Twitter API, and data visualization

This tutorial shows how to scrape data from websites using {rvest}, how to download tweets using the Twitter API and {rtweet}, and how to visualize Wordle-related data using a scatterplot, lollipop chart, word cloud, and stacked barplot.

Data used in this script are from a list of previous Wordle words from [FresherLive](https://latestnews.fresherslive.com/articles/past-wordle-words-list-of-all-past-wordle-answers-can-i-play-past-wordles-354332), a measure of word commonness from [datayze](https://datayze.com/word-analyzer?), and Wordle score distributions from the Twitter bot [\@WordleStats](https://twitter.com/WordleStats).
